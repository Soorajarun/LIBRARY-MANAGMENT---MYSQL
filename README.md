# LIBRARY MANAGMENT - USING MYSQL
MySQL project on LIBRARY MANAGMENT SYSTEM
This project uses MySQL and is based on a library management system.
This project consists of six tables that contain corresponding data for the following categories: Library, Named Branch, Customer, Employee, Books, IssueStatus, and ReturnStatus.

There are foreign keys in some of the tables. 
Every query uses the proper joins and conditions to extract pertinent data from the database while addressing a particular requirement.
I ran a number of queries through the database to determine how many books were available overall, which employees were paid more than $50,000,
Books that cost more than $25 to rent A library branch with more than five employees sorted the books by category based on the number of books in each category.
listed the names of the library's management staff,written query to locate clients based on their registration date
Various kinds of queries, joins, and functions are used for all of the aforementioned data retrievals.
